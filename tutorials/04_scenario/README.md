Tutorials for scenario-based modeling and analysis workflows.

## Tutorials

1. **01_scenario_temperature.ipynb** - Temperature-based scenario modeling
2. **02_scenario_single_location.ipynb** - Detailed single-location scenario analysis
3. **03_scenario_mountain_downselect.ipynb** - Non-uniform mountain terrain downselection

## Notes

All tutorials can run on standard hardware. Tutorial 3 uses cached outputs in the documentation build due to longer execution time, but you can execute it locally in your own environment.

## Topics Covered

- Temperature scenario analysis
- Single-site scenario generation
- Climate-based scenario development
- Terrain-specific modeling
