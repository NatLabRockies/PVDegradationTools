# Welcome to the PVDEG Tutorials

Here is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that provide tutorials for using PVDeg.
These are ready to read, install and use, or run in your browser through Google Colab.
Clicking on the rocket-icon on the top allows you to launch the notebooks on
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for interactive mode.
As per the instructions in each notebook, you should uncomment the first line
that reads `pip install ...` to install the environment if you follow this mode.

You can also clone the repository and run them locally, following the
instructions on the [PVDeg Github page](https://github.com/NREL/PVDegradationTools)

For standalone analysis tools, see the Tools section in the navigation menu or visit the [tools directory](tools/).
