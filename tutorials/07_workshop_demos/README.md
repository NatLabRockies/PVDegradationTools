## About These Demos

These notebooks were created for live demonstrations at workshops and conferences:
- **ASTM**: American Society for Testing and Materials workshops
- **DuraMAT**: DuraMAT Consortium meetings and workshops

The demos showcase practical applications of PVDeg and provide hands-on examples for workshop participants.

## Running the Demos

### Local Execution
Most demos can be run locally. Follow the standard installation instructions in the main tutorials README.

### Google Colab
Demos without HPC requirements can be launched in Google Colab using the rocket icon when viewing through the Jupyter Book.

### HPC Execution
For demos requiring HPC (marked with ⚠️), you must:
1. Have NREL HPC account and allocations
2. Be on NREL network or connected via VPN
3. Follow NREL HPC documentation for job submission
