# PVDeg Tools

This folder contains standalone computational tools for specific PV degradation calculations. These tools are included in the [Jupyter Book](https://nrel.github.io/PVDegradationTools/intro.html) under the Tools section.

For tutorials and guided examples, see the [tutorials](../tutorials/) directory.

## Tools Overview

### Tools - Degradation
General degradation calculation tools and utilities.

### Tools - Edge Seal Oxygen Ingress
Calculations for oxygen ingress through edge seals in PV modules.

### Tools - Module Standoff for IEC TS 63126
**⚠️ Requires NREL HPC Access**

Calculation of module standoff distance according to IEC TS 63126. This tool performs geospatial analysis across multiple locations and requires access to NREL's High Performance Computing (HPC) resources for execution.

## Requirements

Most tools can run locally with standard dependencies. Tools marked with ⚠️ require:
- NREL HPC cluster access
- Additional authentication/credentials
- Specific environment setup

See individual notebooks for detailed requirements.
