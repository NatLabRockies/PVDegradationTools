# NREL HPC Tutorials

Advanced tutorials that require access to NREL's High Performance Computing (HPC) resources.

## ⚠️ HPC Access Required

All tutorials in this folder require:
- Access to NREL's HPC systems (Kestrel, Eagle, etc.)
- NREL network connectivity or VPN
- Appropriate computing allocations

These tutorials are intended for NREL staff and collaborators with HPC access.

## Tutorials

1. **01_geospatial_world_map.ipynb** - Global geospatial analysis and visualization
2. **02_letid_outdoor_geospatial_demo.ipynb** - LETID modeling across geographic regions

## Topics Covered

- Large-scale geospatial computations
- Global PV degradation mapping
- Distributed computing workflows
- High-resolution climate data processing

## Getting Access

If you are an NREL employee or collaborator and need HPC access:
1. Visit the NREL HPC website for account requests
2. Request appropriate computing allocations
3. Set up VPN access if working remotely

## Alternative

If you don't have HPC access, check out the **04_geospatial** folder which includes `01_local_scenario.ipynb` that can run on standard hardware.
